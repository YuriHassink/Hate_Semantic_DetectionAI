ELEARN:
The basic requirement for the ML assignment that you need to fulfil in order to pass the assignment.

Pre-processing 

Clean data; Remove all the irrelevant/ noise from given data set

Feature encoding

    BOW
    TF-IDF

Data split

         Split data into training and testing data 
         Can perform Cross validation (optional)

Designed and train Machine Learning model

    Support vector Machine (SVM)
    Random Forest (RF)
    Naive Bayes

Provide Model Evaluation

    Accuracy
    Recall
    Precision
    F1-score

You are not restricted to using only these feature encoding techniques and models; 
you can experiment with other ML models and can carry out some feature engineering.
